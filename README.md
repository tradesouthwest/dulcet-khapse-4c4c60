Create a Firefox browser extension that promotes healthy work habits by displaying customizable reminders every 25 minutes to take a brief standing break. The extension should:

    Track active browser time
    Display a non-intrusive but noticeable notification after each 25-minute interval
    Include motivational messages encouraging movement and stretching
    
    Allow users to:
        Customize notification duration and frequency
        Choose notification style (popup, banner, or sound)
        Personalize motivational messages
        Temporarily pause tracking when needed
        Log their break compliance (optional)

Please provide the necessary code and implementation steps for creating this extension, ensuring it follows Firefox's WebExtensions API guidelines and best practices for browser performance.
